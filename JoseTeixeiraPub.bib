@article{Teixeira_et_al2015,
abstract = {Many software projects are no longer done in-house by a single organization. Instead, we are in a new age where software is developed by a networked community of individuals and organizations, which base their relations to each other on mutual interest. Paradoxically, recent research suggests that software development can actually be jointly-developed by rival firms. For instance, it is known that the mobile-device makers Apple and Samsung kept collaborating in open source projects while running expensive patent wars in the court. Taking a case study approach, we explore how rival firms collaborate in the open source arena by employing a multi-method approach that combines qualitative analysis of archival data (QA) with mining software repositories (MSR) and Social Network Analysis (SNA). While exploring collaborative processes within the OpenStack ecosystem, our research contributes to Software Engineering research by exploring the role of groups, sub-communities and business models within a high-networked open source ecosystem. Surprising results point out that competition for the same revenue model (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not necessary affect collaboration within the ecosystem. Moreover, while detecting the different sub-communities of the OpenStack community, we found out that the expected social tendency of developers to work with developers from same firm (i.e., homophily) did not hold within the OpenStack ecosystem. Furthermore, while addressing a novel, complex and unexplored open source case, this research also contributes to the management literature in coopetition strategy and high-tech entrepreneurship with a rich description on how heterogeneous actors within a high-networked ecosystem (involving individuals, startups, established firms and public organizations) joint-develop a complex infrastructure for big-data in the open source arena.},

abstract="Much research that analyzes the evolution of a software ecosystem is confined to its own boundaries. Evidence shows, however, that software ecosystems co-evolve independently with other software ecosystems. In other words, understanding the evolution of a software ecosystem requires an especially astute awareness of its competitive landscape and much consideration for other software ecosystems in related markets. A software ecosystem does not evolve in insulation but with other software ecosystems. In this research, we analyzed the OpenStack software ecosystem with a focal perspective that attempted to understand its evolution as a function of other software ecosystems. We attempted to understand and explain the evolution of OpenStack in relation to other software ecosystems in the cloud computing market. Our findings add to theoretical knowledge in software ecosystems by identifying and discussing seven different mechanisms by which software ecosystems mutually influence each other: sedimentation and embeddedness of business relationships, strategic management of the portfolio of business relationships, firms values and reputation as a partner, core technological architecture, design of the APIs, competitive replication of functionality and multi-homing. Research addressing the evolution of software ecosystem should, therefore, acknowledge that software ecosystems entangle with other software ecosystems in multiple ways, even with competing ones. A rigorous analysis of the evolution of a software ecosystem should not be solely confined to its inner boundaries.",

Each of these has its advantages and disadvantages that are context-specific. Recent research reported that many prominent open source software projects have moved from feature-based to time-based releases. In this longitudinal case study, we narrate how OpenStack shifted towards a liberal six-month release cycle. If prior research discussed why projects should adopt time-based releases and how they can adopt such a strategy, we discuss how OpenStack adapted its software development processes, its organizational design and its tools toward a hybrid release management strategy --- a strive for balancing the benefits and drawbacks of feature-based and time-based release strategies.",

abstract={Value co-creation enabled by consumers' use of information systems is a challenging topic which requires more explicit definitions for use of academics and managers. Systemic features are digital services enabling co-creation of value, not being products or services to be paid for, but assisting as consumer-supporting capabilities between different contexts. In order to gain better insight for systemic features within information systems, we collected empirical data from 23 firms in the high-tech sector and analyzed the systemic features. Systemic features were classified and prioritized by a research group. The created purpose-based typology enhances the understanding on why and how value is co-created with customers. We contribute both to systems and business research by suggesting a purpose-based typology defining different purpose-based constructs for systemic features enabling co-creation of value. We also discuss implications for managing and organizing value within the firm and contribution to organization science and theory of the firm.},
